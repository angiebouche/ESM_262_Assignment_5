This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

```{r}
data <- read_csv("GHG.csv")
```




## Summarize: Average natural gas emissions by year
```{r}
ng_emissions = data %>% 
  filter(Fuel_Type == "Natural Gas") %>% 
  select(Total_CO2_Emissions) %>% 
  summarize(mean = (sum(Total_CO2_Emissions)/7))

```


##Summarize: Add up total emisisons by year
```{r}
annual_emissions = data %>% 
  group_by(Year) %>% 
  summarize(sum_col = sum(Total_CO2_Emissions)) %>%  
  arrange(-Year) %>% 
  head(10)

```

## Array:
```{r}

emisisons_year = array(dim=c(5,4,2))
dim(emisisons_year)
emisisons_year #look at what casey posts

# add useful names

dimnames(emissions_year) = list(c("Farm1","Farm2","Farm3","Farm4","Farm5"), 
                      c("apple","avocado","orange","almond"),
                      c("2010", "2016"))


#  use your own function to calculte impact - maybe set a limit and see what secotra are above? If you are "TRUE" you get a fine - add up the total fines for 2010 and 2016?
isdrought = function(sm, thresh) {
  n = length(sm)
  drought=TRUE
  for (i in 1:n) {
    if (sm[i] > thresh) drought=FALSE
  }
  return(drought)
}
soilm
#local drought
apply(soilm, c(1,2), isdrought, thresh=0.4)
```

=======
## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
